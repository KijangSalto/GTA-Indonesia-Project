DES9@00	F6D7639B	What's your take on this?
DES9@01	81D0530D	Damn!
DES9@02	18D902B7	I thought they was your people.
DES9@03	6FDE3221	Listen, Carl. We've got a problem.
DES9@04	F1BAA782	Some traitors from another department
DES9@05	86BD9714	think they can help the 'overseas situation'
DES9@06	1FB4C6AE	by financing militaristic dictators
DES9@07	68B3F638	in exchange for arms contracts.
DES9@08	F80CEBA9	Hey, ain't that exactly what you do?
DES9@09	8F0BDB3F	Well, kind of, but we get to pick our dictators.
DES9@10	EFCC52DA	Degenerates that we can control.
DES9@11	98CB624C	We try to stay the hell away from these guys with principles,
DES9@12	01C233F6	Because that just - muddies the waters.
DES9@13	76C50360	Yeah, OK.
DES9@14	E8A196C3	OK, so, of course these idiots have stolen a consignment of land mines
DES9@15	9FA6A655	and they plan to offload them in the Middle East, and cause a little ruckus...
DES9@16	06AFF7EF	Carl, do you like maiming people? Just curious...
DES9@17	71A8C779	Maiming? Some people, shit...
DES9@18	E117DAE8	Anyway, the point is - you and me, Carl, we're the same.
DES9@19	9610EA7E	Now yeah, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
DES9@20	C4E10119	But if you screw this up, it causes a tinder box situation
DES9@21	B3E6318F	all over Latin America and the Middle East.
DES9@22	2AEF6035	Now look, I spoke to the big man.
DES9@23	5DE850A3	You've got clearance to eliminate these fuckers. How's that?
DES9@24	C38CC500	Huh, man, kill Government agents?
DES9@25	B48BF596	don't look at it that way, will you?
DES9@26	2D82A42C	Think of it as pest control. It works for me.
DES9@27	5A8594BA	All right, come on, I can't stay here now. I'm too hip, I gotta go. OK? I'm outta here.
DES9@28	CA3A892B	And everybody goes crazy and has a lot of problems...
