CAS4A02	B547CCC5	It's CJ. Hey, Truth, is that you?
CAS4A03	C240FC53	Might be.

CAS4A05	2B235966	so don't admit anything!
CAS4A06	B22A08DC	Whatever, man. Whassup?
CAS4A07	C52D384A	I need a favor, Carl, thought I could cash in some karma chips.
CAS4A08	559225DB	Your credit good.
CAS4A09	2295154D	I took some fellow travelers deep into the desert
CAS4A10	42529CA8	on a peyote safari a few nights back.
CAS4A11	3555AC3E	We faced the inner light and communed with the lizard king.
CAS4A12	AC5CFD84	Sounds fun. How did it go?
CAS4A13	DB5BCD12	That's the problem, I don't know.
CAS4A14	453F58B1	I'm in Los Santos.
CAS4A15	32386827	I woke up in a Japanese bathhouse about an hour ago.
CAS4A16	AB31399D	I have no idea how I got here or where the others are.
CAS4A17	DC36090B	They're probably fine.
CAS4A18	4C89149A	I don't think so.
CAS4A19	3B8E240C	They were Brits - a band and their managers.
CAS4A20	697FCF6B	They have no experience about the desert.
CAS4A21	1E78FFFD	OK, where'd you make camp? I can go have a look.
CAS4A22	8771AE47	I took 'em up Arco del Oeste - fantastic sunsets.
CAS4A23	F0769ED1	Best start looking for them up there.
CAS4B00	590F13B0	Hello? Hey, anybody out here? Truth sent me!
CAS4B01	2E082326	EH! Over 'ere!
CAS4B02	B701729C	Hey, man, you all right?
CAS4B03	C006420A	'Kin'ell, I'm fucking hanging.
CAS4B04	5E62D7A9	Stone me bloody crows. Where am I?
CAS4B05	2965E73F	I dunno, mate. I was having a dream;
CAS4B06	B06CB685	I was wanking over some fat bird's tits when this twat turned up.
CAS4B07	C76B8613	Oh fuck.
CAS4B08	57D49B82	Maccer, you fucking psycho! You did it again, didn't you!
CAS4B09	20D3AB14	That peyote was shite, you were lucky I brought some tabs along!
CAS4B10	401422F1	I've told you a million times not to put stuff in my fucking drink!
CAS4B11	37131267	Oh, piss off, kidder!
CAS4B12	AE1A43DD	Who are you again?
CAS4B13	D91D734B	Where are we?
CAS4B14	4779E6E8	Oh, I'm a friend of The Truth's.
CAS4B15	307ED67E	He said you guys might need a ride into town or something.
CAS4B16	A97787C4	But I'm a fucking raspberry!
CAS4B17	DE70B752	You're not a fucking raspberry!
CAS4B18	4ECFAAC3	I can't feel me legs, our P.
CAS4B19	39C89A55	I've wanked the use out of them!
CAS4B20	6B397132	Just stand up, you soppy cunt.
CAS4B21	1C3E41A4	We go through this every weekend.
CAS4B22	8537101E	Man, what the hell was y'all doing last night?
CAS4B23	F2302088	So, where am I taking y'all?
CAS4B24	6C54B52B	Anybody got a rag?
CAS4B25	1B5385BD	I've got a pal, Rosie.
CAS4B26	825AD407	He's got some casino gig going down in Venturas. Sweet.
CAS4B27	F55DE491	Fuck off, string.
CAS4B28	65E2F900	Oh, charming.
CAS4B29	12E5C996	Well it felt like I couldn't feel them, honest!
CAS4B30	72224073	Ah! Ooh!
CAS4B31	052570E5	Alright.
CAS4B32	9C2C215F	Alright, ladies, let's go.
CAS4B33	EB2B11C9	Come on. Fucking Northerners...
CAS4C00	58CD7987	Kent Paul, here to see Rosie.
CAS4C01	2FCA4911	Hey boss, there's somebody here to see you.
CAS4C02	B6C318AB	Oh, go away, I have a migraine.
CAS4C03	C1C4283D	Oi, Rosie, son, it's me, Paulo!
CAS4C04	5FA0BD9E	Oh God.
CAS4C05	28A78D08	My despair is complete.
CAS4C06	B1AEDCB2	OK, let him in.
CAS4C07	C6A9EC24	Rosiiieee! How are you, me old son?
CAS4C08	5616F1B5	I pray that one day I can escape my perpetual torment
CAS4C09	2111C123	and retire in peace and comfort a million miles away
CAS4C10	41D648C6	from anyone I've ever fucking known and, instead, I get this.
CAS4C11	36D17850	Come on, it's me, Kent Paul!
CAS4C12	AFD829EA	Well, hello Paul, what a pleasant surprise. Who the hell are these guys?
CAS4C13	D8DF197C	These are my boys - Maccer and Carl.
CAS4C14	46BB8CDF	Wassup?
CAS4C15	31BCBC49	You want any Speckled Doves, boss?
CAS4C16	A8B5EDF3	I'm peaking on one right now.
CAS4C17	DFB2DD65	Top-of-the-range, man.
CAS4C18	4F0DC0F4	Well it's fitting.
CAS4C19	380AF062	As I sit here up to my neck in a river of shit,
CAS4C20	6AFB1B05	with every Mafia gorilla from Liberty City to Los Santos
CAS4C21	1DFC2B93	pissing in my face, that you, Kent Paul, should witness it.
CAS4C22	84F57A29	What's the matter, son?
CAS4C23	F3F24ABF	Too numerous, oppressively insurmountable
CAS4C24	6D96DF1C	and depressingly fucking typical even to mention.
CAS4C25	1A91EF8A	It's alright, bruv, Paulo can help.
CAS4C26	8398BE30	Give us some space would you, son.
CAS4C27	F49F8EA6	I'll give you a tinkle later.
CAS4C28	64209337	Alright, for sure.
CAS4C29	1327A3A1	Not you, Maccer.
CAS4C30	73E02A44	Oh, you twat.
CAS4C31	04E71AD2	Unbelievable.
