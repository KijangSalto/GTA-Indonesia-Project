WOO1@00	61DE94C2	We're closed! Pokgai!
WOO1@01	16D9A454	Easy, man, I'm here to see Woozie.
WOO1@02	8FD0F5EE	Oh. Upstairs.
WOO1@03	F8D7C578	I'm Johnson. I'm here to see Woozie, I work with him.
WOO1@04	66B350DB	You know of the boss's curse?
WOO1@05	11B4604D	Curse? Nah.
WOO1@06	88BD31F7	He's blind.
WOO1@07	FFBA0161	Blind? But we was just racing cars last week!
WOO1@08	6F051CF0	Yes, I know. He is blessed with unbelievable good fortune.
WOO1@09	18022C66	And the Triad that would do anything for him.
WOO1@10	78C5A583	We call him our Lucky Mole.
WOO1@11	0FC29515	A'ight. I'll keep that in mind.
WOO1@12	96CBC4AF	Good.
WOO1@13	E1CCF439	Woozie!
WOO1@14	7FA8619A	Hello, Carl.
WOO1@15	08AF510C	Hey, what's happening Woozie - y'know, how you doin'?
WOO1@16	91A600B6	Straight to the facts;
WOO1@17	E6A13020	I can't use your help unless I'm open with you
WOO1@18	761E2DB1	about who I am and what I do.
WOO1@19	01191D27	Let me re-introduce myself...
WOO1@20	53E8F640	I am the boss of the Mountain Cloud Boys.
WOO1@21	24EFC6D6	Nice to meet you.
WOO1@22	BDE6976C	Likewise. Why don't you sit down.
WOO1@23	CAE1A7FA	As Dai Dai Lo of the Triad, it is my responsibility to see
WOO1@24	54853259	that disputes are settled without...damaging important business.
WOO1@25	238202CF	Where I come in at?
WOO1@26	BA8B5375	We shall see.
WOO1@27	CD8C63E3	I'm about to drop in on a local Triad
WOO1@28	5D337E72	that failed to show face at the last Tong meeting.
WOO1@29	2A344EE4	Come with me, and you'll see how we Triads settle things
WOO1@30	4AF3C701	without recourse to...unnecessary violence.
WOO1@31	3DF4F797	A'ight, I'll ride with you.
WOO1@32	A4FDA62D	Stupid ass motherfucker...
WOO1@33	D3FA96BB	Yes, right this way.
WUZ1_AA	6DCF409D	We'll need a ride, mine's getting some bodywork done to it.
WUZ1_AB	F4C61127	Alright, don't trip.
WUZ1_BA	46E2135E	Hurry up, Woozie. What's the problem?
WUZ1_BB	DFEB42E4	Yeah, err, I'm just checking my bearings.
WUZ1_CA	5FF9221F	The Blood Feather Triad have a storehouse around the block.
WUZ1_CB	C6F073A5	We shall see what excuses they have to offer.
WUZ1_CC	B1F74333	OK. So what's all this talk of business?
WUZ1_CD	2F93D690	Some small time Vietnamese gangs have been making trouble lately.
WUZ1_CE	5894E606	We're not sure why they're gaining any courage now, but I'm nervous about the situation.
WUZ1_CG	B69A872A	How do I fit in all of this?
WUZ1_CH	26259ABB	You're an outsider.
WUZ1_DA	10B8B4D8	This is the place!
WUZ1_DB	89B1E562	What's that smell?
WUZ1_DC	FEB6D5F4	Laundry.
WUZ1_DD	60D24057	Come on, it's this way.
WUZ1_EA	09A38599	Hey, what's with all these people?
WUZ1_EB	90AAD423	Where they going?
WUZ1_EC	E7ADE4B5	Something isn't right here. We should be careful...
WUZ1_EE	0ECE4180	Follow me.
WUZ1_FA	228ED65A	Something's not right.
WUZ1_FB	BB8787E0	No shit, where everybody at?
WUZ1_FC	CC80B776	Hiding, scared. I can smell them.
WUZ1_FD	52E422D5	We should proceed with caution.
WUZ1_FE	25E31243	This way, I think.
WUZ1_GA	3B95E71B	Hold on, just getting my bearings.
WUZ1_GB	A29CB6A1	This is very interesting...
WUZ1_GC	D59B8637	Hmmm, yes, intriguing...
WUZ1_GD	4BFF1394	With the wind on my right, sooo...
WUZ1_GE	3CF82302	Was it fifteen paces, or fifteen feet?
WUZ1_GF	A5F172B8	Ah, no, now I've got it...
WUZ1_GG	D2F6422E	Two stalls then turn left, no, no, right...
WUZ1_GH	42495FBF	That's the smell I was after.
WUZ1_GJ	AC473E93	Now... where's that loose cobble?
WUZ1_GK	DB400E05	Should be a sewer right about here...
WUZ1_GL	45249BA6	Ah, the unmistakable skitter of tiny rat feet!
WUZ1_GM	3223AB30	18, 19, twenty. Now was it right or left?
WUZ1_HA	BC0DFBD4	Do you hear something?

WUZ1_LB	41686F6A	Here, this is the place.
WUZ1_LC	366F5FFC	Strange, this gate is usually locked.
WUZ1_LD	A80BCA5F	Odd, this gate should be locked...
WUZ1_MA	C17A0F91	Oh man, Woozie...

WUZ1_MF	5F1E9A32	Dai Dai Lo! Forgive me, I was too scared to fight, so I hid.
WUZ1_MG	2819AAA4	Enough! What happened here?
