STP2_13	9BED6982	~s~A ~r~guard ~s~is patrolling the swimming pool area. Observing his route will allow you to work out how to get past him undetected.
STP2_14	0589FC21	~s~There are lots of shadows in this area to hide in. Hiding in shadows makes it difficult for a ~r~guard ~s~to spot you.
STP2_15	728ECCB7	~s~A ~r~guard ~s~is coming.
STP2_16	EB879D0D	~s~Find a suitable place to hide before he spots you. Look for an area with shadows.
STP2_19	7B38809C	~s~If you walk straight past the ~r~guard ~s~here he will see you. Try crouching and walking past the bar to remain out of his line of sight.

STP2_32	DEDC3B96	Using the camera movement controls you can rotate the camera, this is for looking around corners and spotting enemies.
STP2_33	A9DB0B00	The ~r~guards ~w~are using silenced guns. If you manage to obtain one it will allow you to fire a gun without being heard by nearby guards.
STP2_36	D9B1FF8F	To stay hidden you have to stay crouched and walk past the bar.
STP2_39	490EE21E	~r~Madd Dogg's personal security ~s~are patrolling the mansion. Do not use any guns on your way to the rhyme book - you will alert them. Use stealth to steal the rhyme book.

STP2_40	7F93CC7D	~y~Exit ~s~the mansion and get the rhyme book back to OG loc. It's safe to use your weapons now, although it may be less risky if you use stealth to get past any ~r~guards ~s~on patrol.
STP2_41	0894FCEB	If the white blip on the radar that represents your position turns blue it indicates that you are in the shadows and are hidden from patrolling guards.
STP2_5	8EC6F6EA	~s~The first ~r~guard ~s~cannot see you. This means you can sneak up behind him with a melee weapon and perform a ~h~stealth kill~s~.
STP2_7	60C897C6	~s~The patrolling ~r~guards ~s~are shown on the radar by the red blips which point in the direction the security guards are facing.
STP2_9	8770BAC1	If you crouch while you move you will make less noise. Crouch and then target the ~r~guard.
