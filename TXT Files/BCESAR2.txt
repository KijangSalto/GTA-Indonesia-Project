BCE2@00	7BFF509F	Hey Carl.
BCE2@01	0CF86009	How you doin' sis?
BCE2@02	95F131B3	Better. Thank you. You came through for me.
BCE2@03	E2F60125	This ain't over, man. I did this to take care of my woman.
BCE2@04	7C929486	But now I'm gonna head straight back home,
BCE2@05	0B95A410	and I'm gonna cap me some fucking dope dealers!
BCE2@06	929CF5AA	Hey look, you go into the barrio with that big willy bullshit,
BCE2@07	E59BC53C	and you gonna get shredded.
BCE2@08	7524D8AD	And I ain't losing you over no macho bullshit!
BCE2@09	0223E83B	Hey, relax, man.
BCE2@10	62E461DE	It's gonna get handled when it's time.
BCE2@11	15E35148	We already know who the fucking bad guys are, man,
BCE2@12	8CEA00F2	your stinking Grove Street brother Smoke,
BCE2@13	FBED3064	and those chota pigs Tenpenny and Pulaski!
BCE2@14	6589A5C7	Smoke, he's a pusher, man!
BCE2@15	128E9551	No, no, not Smoke, he might mess with C.R.A.S.H,
BCE2@16	8B87C4EB	but he don't mess with no yay.
BCE2@17	FC80F47D	Come on, CJ! How you think he got that new house, huh?
BCE2@18	6C3FE9EC	Just let that Grove-for-life bullshit go and take a look around you.
BCE2@19	1B38D97A	Word on the street is twice a week,
BCE2@20	49C9321D	Smoke sends a car out to San Fierro,
BCE2@21	3ECE028B	and the trunk comes back full of white.
BCE2@22	A7C75331	Shit. I gotta keep my eye on the highway to San Fierro.
BCE2@23	D0C063A7	Maybe I'll see something.
BCE2@24	4EA4F604	Just... Just lay low and I'll be back.
