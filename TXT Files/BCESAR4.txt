BCE4@00	5E940F43	Hey, I've been waiting forever, man. Where the hell you been?
BCE4@01	29933FD5	Sorry, holmes, I had no idea when the race would be.
BCE4@02	B09A6E6F	Riiight - you just happened to show up
BCE4@03	C79D5EF9	five minutes after everybody else, huh?
BCE4@04	59F9CB5A	When the gasoline runs through your veins like the burning passion,
BCE4@05	2EFEFBCC	you know when it's time to race!
BCE4@06	B7F7AA76	I think you're getting high on that country air, man!
BCE4@07	C0F09AE0	Hey, CJ, look...
BCE4@08	504F8771	You haven't been to one of our meets before,
BCE4@09	2748B7E7	where you from, friend?
BCE4@10	478F3E02	I'm from Grove Street Families, Los Santos. What's happening?
BCE4@11	30880E94	Relax. This isn't a parade, pal. But, you know, we gotta be careful.
BCE4@12	A9815F2E	Wu Zi Mu, but my friends call me 'Woozie'. How you doing?
BCE4@13	DE866FB8	Wha..? CJ. Carl Johnson.
BCE4@14	40E2FA1B	Listen, out here we like to race for cash or pink slips - racer's choice.
BCE4@15	37E5CA8D	Get your car started, we're about to go. Good luck, Carl Johnson.
BCE4@16	AEEC9B37	Be careful CJ!
BCE4@17	D9EBABA1	There's something real strange about that dude, man.
BCE4@18	4954B630	Man, where is this guy?
BCE4@19	3E5386A6	For sure, man.
BCE4W00	47FDBAB6	You drive with style, Carl Johnson -
BCE4W01	30FA8A20	and I never mind losing to a guy who's willing to push himself right to the edge.
BCE4W02	A9F3DB9A	As for me, I'm a man who honors his bet.
BCE4W03	DEF4EB0C	Well, you learn pretty fast with the police on your ass.
BCE4W04	40907EAF	Listen, it's best if we clear the hell out of here as soon as possible
BCE4W05	37974E39	because, for some reason, the local police don't appreciate our noble sport.
BCE4W06	AE9E1F83	Yeah. Thanks for the advice.
BCE4W07	D9992F15	OK, I gotta go.
BCE4W08	49263284	Uh, you know what? If you ever find yourself in San Fierro, give me a call,
BCE4W09	3E210212	maybe we can do a little business together.
BCE4W10	5EE68BF7	Yeah, I might just do that.
BCE4W11	29E1BB61	I guess that's our wake up call. Nice meeting you.
BCE4W12	B0E8EADB	Oooh, yeah!
BCE5@00	E6286826	Damn, man, now what?
BCE5@01	912F58B0	PIG!
BCE5@02	0826090A	What? What'd I do now?
BCE5@03	7F21399C	Oh, so THIS is where you been, eh?
BCE5@04	E145AC3F	THIS is how you repay my tenderness!
BCE5@05	96429CA9	You prefer the curves of some car to those of a real woman?
BCE5@06	0F4BCD13	Look, Catalina, you called it off, remember, 'just business'.
BCE5@07	784CFD85	What kind of a man are you?
BCE5@08	E8F3E014	When I say 'just business', I mean that I love you!
BCE5@09	9FF4D082	When I say, I no interested no more, I mean that I long for you!
BCE5@10	FF335967	Wait, Catalina, wait! Leave my car alone,
BCE5@11	883469F1	I did this for us, for me and you!
BCE5@12	113D384B	It's too late. I don't love you no more. I love another, OK?
BCE5@13	663A08DD	What?
BCE5@14	F85E9D7E	Then what the fuck was this about?
BCE5@15	8F59ADE8	I cannot keep my passions holed up, they need a release.
BCE5@16	1650FC52	That was a good release,
BCE5@17	6157CCC4	like hitting a man with a frying pan while he sleeps.
BCE5@18	F1E8D155	This, CARL, THIS is my new man.
BCE5@19	86EFE1C3	Are you jealous? Are you going to fight for me?
BCE5@20	D41E0AA4	No, no, I can take rejection.
BCE5@21	A3193A32	You are jealous and a coward!
BCE5@22	3A106B88	Now let's race!
BCE5@23	4D175B1E	Crazy bitch.
BCE5@24	D373CEBD	What the fuck?
BCE5@25	A474FE2B	Wait! Hey, that's my...
BCE5@26	3D7DAF91	And when I said that I missed you..!
BCE5W00	FF41DDD3	You had the unfair advantage!
BCE5W01	8846ED45	Being a better driver ain't no unfair advantage.
BCE5W02	114FBCFF	You think you're clever, but it is you who is missing the point!
BCE5W03	66488C69	Not only was he racing, but he was satisfying me, fully!
BCE5W04	F82C19CA	The advantage of a stick shift, I guess.
BCE5W05	8F2B295C	Yeah whatever, anyway, man, what is it, cash or pink slip?
BCE5W06	162278E6	There you go!
BCE5W07	61254870	Goodbye Mr. Johnson, I will NOT be missing you!
BCE5W08	F19A55E1	Hey, wait a minute, bitch! What is this shit?
BCE5W09	869D6577	The deed to a garage in San Fierro.
BCE5W10	E65AEC92	My lover needs his car so we can go to Liberty City.
BCE5W11	915DDC04	Liberty City? Yeah, whatever, have a good time.
BCE5W12	08548DBE	I will.
BCE5W13	7F53BD28	Fine.
BCE5W14	E137288B	OK.
BCE5W15	9630181D	GOODBYE!
BCE5W16	0F3949A7	What are you gonna say about that?
BCE5W17	783E7931	Go, I ain't gonna miss you.
BCS5_AA	0FD4E754	Oh, Claude, you're so big and manful!
BCS5_AB	96DDB6EE	Claude, you're the best driver I've ever bedded!
BCS5_AC	E1DA8678	Hands on the wheel, Claude, hands on the wheel!
BCS5_AD	7FBE13DB	Oh Claude, it's bigger than the gear stick!
BCS5_AE	08B9234D	I have never felt so satisfied!
BCS5_AF	91B072F7	Five orgasms in as many minutes!
BCS5_AG	E6B74261	Marry me, Claude, marry me!
BCS5_AH	76085FF0	Oh Claude, I don't know if I'm woman enough!
BCS5_BA	24F9B497	Hey, Carl, you drive like a drunken camel!
BCS5_BB	BDF0E52D	Carl, are you jealous, heh?
BCS5_BC	CAF7D5BB	Claude has such girth, he is AMAZING!
BCS5_BD	54934018	Claude would make you feel inadequate!
BCS5_BE	2394708E	At last I have found a man to satisfy me!
BCS5_BF	BA9D2134	Claude is so manful, so FORCEFUL!
BCS5_BG	CD9A11A2	I never knew there was so much MORE to sex!
