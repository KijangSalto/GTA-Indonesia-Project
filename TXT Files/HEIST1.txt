HEI1_20	FBDF28EC	~s~That's it! That fire alarm ought to occupy those guards.
HEI1_22	15D149C0	~s~Okay! They're busy with the evacuation just now. Get upstairs and photograph those ~y~blueprints~s~ pinned to the wall.

HEI1_50	B49EBE2B	~r~You were told that this is a low-profile job and you were showing off your weaponry!
HEI1_52	5A90DF07	~r~That's just great! We should have distracted the guard before taking any photographs!
HEI1_6	0C094D76	~s~You can't photo the casino blueprints with the guard around! You need to divert his attention.
