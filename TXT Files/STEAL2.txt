STL2_BA	84E42924	I like this place, you know.
STL2_BB	1DED789E	Where?
STL2_BC	6AEA4808	San Fierro, man.
STL2_BD	F48EDDAB	My home will always be the Varrios and El Corona,
STL2_BE	8389ED3D	but this city, it has something gentle about it.
STL2_BF	1A80BC87	Yeah, I know what you mean.
STL2_BG	6D878C11	Kendl seems to like it too, you know?
STL2_BH	FD389180	Oh yeah, she's really getting her head into this business thing.
STL2_BJ	1336F0AC	That's good, she's always been the brains in the family.
STL2_BK	6431C03A	She should get out the ghetto and make something of herself.

STL2_CA	9DFF1865	Hey, who's this 'Truth' guy, holmes? I don't think he's wrapped too tight!
STL2_CB	04F649DF	He just sees everything from a different perspective, that's all.
STL2_CC	73F17949	At first I thought he was just another acid casualty fruit cake.
STL2_CD	ED95ECEA	But some of the things he say...
STL2_CE	9A92DC7C	I don't know, man, it ain't all bullshit....
STL2_CF	039B8DC6	Hey, you gonna become an alien hunter, holmes?
