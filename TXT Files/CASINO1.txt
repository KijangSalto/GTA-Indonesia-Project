CAS1A00	6C975DDB	Idiot! Do you realize how much those machines cost?
CAS1A01	1B906D4D	We're supposed to be opening in -
CAS1A02	82993CF7	What the fuck was that?
CAS1A03	F59E0C61	Hello? HELLO? What the fuck is wrong with you people?
CAS1A04	6BFA99C2	Boss, CJ's here.
CAS1A05	1CFDA954	Carl, glad you could make it.
CAS1A06	85F4F8EE	So this is what you've been doing.
CAS1A07	F2F3C878	Yeah, it's been a complete nightmare.
CAS1A08	624CD5E9	You want a stomach ulcer, try opening a Triad casino in a Mafia-run town!
CAS1A09	154BE57F	The mob trying to squeeze you?
CAS1A10	758C6C9A	Yeah - the corporations are moving in and everybody's feeling the squeeze.
CAS1A11	028B5C0C	I've had slot machines busted up, workmen being scared off...
CAS1A12	9B820DB6	So who's behind this?
CAS1A13	EC853D20	Well, there are these three mob families operating here,
CAS1A14	72E1A883	and each of them has a stake in Caligula's Casino
CAS1A15	05E69815	and some wacked-out lawyer's running it for them.
CAS1A16	9CEFC9AF	It could be any one of them, or all of 'em.
CAS1A17	EBE8F939	Can't you just give them a little something?
CAS1A18	7B57E4A8	No. In addition to the usual authorities that need bribing,
CAS1A19	0C50D43E	each one would want a slice
CAS1A20	5EA13F59	and I'm not about to hand over all our profits to some wiseguy Italians!
CAS1A21	29A60FCF	Our profit?
CAS1A22	B0AF5E75	That's right, you heard me. I want to offer you a share in our casino,
CAS1A23	C7A86EE3	in exchange for some help setting it up.
CAS1A24	59CCFB40	How does that sound, partner?
CAS1A25	2ECBCBD6	Sounds like we got a deal then!
CAS1A26	B7C29A6C	Boss! The boys found some thugs trying to smash one of the deliveries.
CAS1A27	C0C5AAFA	We caught one of them!
CAS1A28	507AB76B	Get rid of him.
CAS1A29	277D87FD	Whoever's behind this - we need to let them know
CAS1A30	47BA0E18	that they're dealing with fully-fledged psychos.
CAS1A31	30BD3E8E	Tie him to the front of the car, let him sweat it out a little
CAS1A32	A9B46F34	and I'll be out there in a little while.
CAS1A33	DEB35FA2	See if we can make this guy squeal.
CAS1A34	40D7CA01	Hey, wait - hold up, hold up, come here.
CAS1A35	37D0FA97	That's my Carl!
CAS1B00	6ED1E382	Hey, hey, who the fuck - who are you? Untie me, huh?
CAS1B01	19D6D314	I've been here for fucking ages, I can't feel my hands no more!
CAS1B02	80DF82AE	You know what? I thing we're gonna take a little drive.
CAS1B03	F7D8B238	What are you, fucking stupid? I'm not joking here - untie me, motherfucker.
CAS1B04	69BC279B	No, I think I'm gonna leave you right where you are.
CAS1B05	1EBB170D	You got any idea in that pea brain head of yours who the fuck I am?
CAS1B06	87B246B7	No, but I think I'm going to find out.
