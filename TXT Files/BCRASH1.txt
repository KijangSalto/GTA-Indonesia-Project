BCR1@00	BB8AB4E3	Wake up, boy.
BCR1@01	CC8D8475	Carl. Hey Carl.
BCR1@02	5584D5CF	What's going on?
BCR1@03	2283E559	You got a bag over your head, boy. How you feel about that?
BCR1@04	BCE770FA	Man, take it off. Please, man, I can't breathe! Please!
BCR1@05	CBE0406C	Oh, alright. But only because you said please.
BCR1@06	52E911D6	You fucking sick motherfucker!
BCR1@07	25EE2140	Intimidate those who intimidate others, Carl. It's my job.
BCR1@08	B5513CD1	Hey, man, where we at?
BCR1@09	C2560C47	The middle of fucking nowhere. Nice, clean air.
BCR1@10	A29185A2	Fucking Smoke! Oh, Sweet!
BCR1@11	D596B534	Sweet is alive.
BCR1@12	4C9FE48E	Alive and inside. He's in a prison hospital being treated for gunshot wounds, awaiting trial.
BCR1@13	3B98D418	Yeah, somehow, nobody's caught you yet.
BCR1@14	A5FC41BB	We've done you a big favor.
BCR1@15	D2FB712D	Oh yeah, you should be glad, Carl. Your moron brother's alive.
BCR1@16	4BF22097	Your street trash, soon to be turned out sister's alive.
BCR1@17	3CF51001	And, she's only sucking one greaseball's dick.
BCR1@18	AC4A0D90	Things are going pretty well for you, Carl.
BCR1@19	DB4D3D06	So behave, nigga.
BCR1@20	89BCD661	We want you to do a little favor for us, Carl.
BCR1@21	FEBBE6F7	Yeah, an eye for an eye, and all that.
BCR1@22	67B2B74D	I can't believe that nigga Smoke turned on me.
BCR1@23	10B587DB	Smoke? Smoke does exactly what he's told.
BCR1@24	8ED11278	He learned that lesson a long time ago.
BCR1@25	F9D622EE	Homies for life? Street loyalty? That's all bullshit, Carl.
BCR1@26	60DF7354	Didn't you learn that when they ran you out of town,
BCR1@27	17D843C2	just cause you'se a buster?
BCR1@28	87675E53	just 'cause you let Brian die? Huh?
BCR1@29	F0606EC5	Eddie, I can't deal with this guy. He's an idiot!
BCR1@30	90A7E720	Let me air this fucker out, I...
BCR1@31	E7A0D7B6	No no no no no no no, officer..
BCR1@32	7EA9860C	For once, let's let the kid do something good with his useless life.
BCR1@33	09AEB69A	He's gonna help us with the fight against crime. Right, Carl?
BCR1@34	97CA2339	Yeah. By any means necessary.
BCR1@35	E0CD13AF	Now you stay the fuck away from Smoke,
BCR1@36	79C44215	and stay the fuck away from us.
BCR1@37	0EC37283	Otherwise Sweet is going to find himself on a Ballas block
BCR1@38	9E7C6F12	getting in touch with his feminine side.
BCR1@39	E97B5F84	Hey Hernandez, you going to piss all day?
BCR1@40	DFE671E7	For some reason, we've got a little problem with a former friend of ours,
BCR1@41	A8E14171	he seems to disagree with some of our methods.
BCR1@42	31E810CB	Yeah, you'll never find anybody as fork-tongued as this snake ass bastard.
BCR1@43	46EF205D	Soon as he gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar,
BCR1@44	D88BB5FE	he'll whistle any tune Internal Affairs wants him to.
BCR1@45	AF8C8568	See, they've got him hiding up Mount Chiliad someplace,
BCR1@46	3685D4D2	so they can manipulate his testimony any way they want to.
BCR1@47	4182E444	I want you to pay him a little visit, Carl. And destroy all his evidence before he testifies.
BCR1@48	D13DF9D5	Sort this out, Carl, so Officer Tenpenny can sleep easy at night.
BCR1@49	A63AC943	We want evidence he ain't gonna talk.
BCR1@94	6D25CBB3	Now who could do that?
BCR1@95	1A22FB25	Get your hands off me, man.
BCR1@96	832BAA9F	Come here.
BCR1@97	F42C9A09	Damn, man. Take it easy!
BCR1@98	64938798	Sounds like your wife.
