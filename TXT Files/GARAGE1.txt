GAR1_AA	A226D71F	C'mon, man, there's these two guys I know - used to work on marine engines,
GAR1_AB	3B2F86A5	'til the mob bought their business over in Vice.
GAR1_AC	4C28B633	Now they try and make ends meet by taking any old job.
GAR1_AD	D24C2390	They're a little bit dulled by their habit,
GAR1_AE	A54B1306	but the smoke don't get in the way of their skills with an engine.
GAR1_AF	3C4242BC	We'll pick up Jethro first.

GAR1_AH	DBFA6FBB	Last I heard, he was working at a garage over East Esplanade way.
GAR1_AJ	35F40E97	Last I heard, he was working at a garage over North Esplanade way.
GAR1_BA	890B84DC	Hey man, how'd you meet these dudes anyway?
GAR1_BB	1002D566	I met them at the '89 Fierro Love-in, apparently.
GAR1_BC	6705E5F0	Apparently?
GAR1_BD	F9617053	You know how it is, man,
GAR1_BE	8E6640C5	a field of tents, crazy-assed music,
GAR1_BF	176F117F	a quart of mescaline vodka, polar bears...
GAR1_BG	606821E9	Polar bears?
GAR1_BH	F0D73C78	Yeah. Go figure. But they were funny guys, man - great sense of humor.
GAR1_CA	9010B59D	This here's Vietnamese gang territory.
GAR1_CB	0919E427	Da Nang Boys, Shining Razors, Butterfly Children.
GAR1_CC	7E1ED4B1	Watch yourself, dude. These cats are real serious.
GAR1_DA	DF51235A	Hey, Jethro!
GAR1_DB	465872E0	Hey there Truth dude!
GAR1_DC	315F4276	Oh man, do I owe you?
GAR1_DD	AF3BD7D5	Coz I swear I paid for that weed, dude!
GAR1_DE	D83CE743	No, man, we're good, I think.
GAR1_DF	4135B6F9	Hop in, man. I've landed you a real job.
GAR1_EA	C64A121B	Jethro, Carl. Carl, Jethro.
GAR1_EB	5F4343A1	Wassup man.
GAR1_EC	28447337	Can we swing by the hospital, it's over in Santa Flora district, west of here.
GAR1_ED	B620E694	Yeah, you sick?
GAR1_EE	C127D602	No. The government is, but that's a long story.
GAR1_FA	ED6741D8	So y'know, like what's the deal, dudes?
GAR1_FB	746E1062	I'm opening a garage in Doherty by the waste ground.
GAR1_FC	036920F4	You know, car mods, lowriders, all that shit.
GAR1_FD	9D0DB557	You down?
GAR1_FE	EA0A85C1	Do polar bears shit in the woods?
GAR1_FF	7303D47B	No, but they've been known to shit in the liquor tent, if I remember it right.
GAR1_FG	0404E4ED	Yeah, that was, like, so far gone, man.
GAR1_GA	F47C7099	What we here for, anyway?
GAR1_GB	6D752123	Nothin'.
GAR1_GC	1A7211B5	Ooh, don't look.
GAR1_GD	84168416	Cover your faces.

GAR1_HA	73E46C56	C'mon, dude, what's all that about?
GAR1_HB	EAED3DEC	You don't want to know.
GAR1_HC	9DEA0D7A	Why?
GAR1_HD	038E98D9	Do you know what a sub-dermal neurophone is?
GAR1_HE	7489A84F	A what?

GAR1_HG	9A87C963	Sometimes it's best to stay in the dark, kid.
GAR1_JA	41D20ED4	Dude, Dwaine, man, how's the hot dog business?
GAR1_JB	D8DB5F6E	It's totally shit. Why, what's happenin'?
GAR1_JC	AFDC6FF8	Uh, my friend Carl here is opening a chop shop.

GAR1_JJ	D600D75C	I'll see y'all later.
GAR1_KA	58C93F95	OK, next stop the cop station downtown.
GAR1_KB	C1C06E2F	What? You out your mind! Why?
GAR1_KC	B6C75EB9	If I told you, the likelihood is you'd get a probe up your ass within a month.
GAR1_KD	28A3CB1A	Like, listen to the man, dude, he's real serious about that shit.
GAR1_KE	5FA4FB8C	Wuh? OK, but you're starting to freak me out with all that space shit, man.
GAR1_LA	1788A952	OK, you know the drill.
GAR1_LB	8E81F8E8	Don't look interested in anything.
GAR1_LC	F986C87E	Picture a pink golfball in your mind.
GAR1_LD	67E25DDD	OK, we're good to go.
GAR1_MA	0E939813	Where to next, Spacehead?
GAR1_MB	979AC9A9	There's an electronics guy I've had dealings with,
GAR1_MC	E09DF93F	goes by the name of ZERO.
GAR1_MD	7EF96C9C	He could fix a supercomputer with a paperclip.
GAR1_ME	09FE5C0A	He's got his own shop,
GAR1_MF	90F70DB0	but he's always ready to help fellow travelers along the path.
GAR1_MG	E7F03D26	Let's go introduce you to him
GAR1_NA	25BECBD0	Look, what's goin' on, Truth?
GAR1_NB	BCB79A6A	Who was them dudes?
GAR1_NC	CBB0AAFC	Don't go there, man.
GAR1_ND	55D43F5F	Listen to Jethro.
GAR1_NE	22D30FC9	Now, what if I told you we never went to the moon,
GAR1_NF	BBDA5E73	JFK lives in Scotland with Janis Joplin,
GAR1_NG	CCDD6EE5	and the only reason we've been in a cold war for the last forty-five years,
GAR1_NH	5C627374	was because snake-headed aliens run the oil business?
GAR1_NJ	B26C1258	I think you popped another microdot.
GAR1_NK	C56B22CE	Good. Keep it that way.
GAR1_OA	3CA5FA91	Blow the horn.

GAR1_PA	F1FFF40F	Carl, Zero, Zero, Carl.
GAR1_PB	68F6A5B5	Sup.
GAR1_PC	1FF19523	Carl here is opening a garage around the corner.
GAR1_PD	81950080	I told him you're the man to speak to when it comes to electronics.
GAR1_PE	F6923016	Actually, I'm the ONLY man to speak to.
GAR1_PF	6F9B61AC	You should drop by the shop sometime, see some of my shit, bro.
GAR1_PG	189C513A	I'll do that.
GAR1_PH	88234CAB	OK, we here.

GAR1B03	3EF7BF9B	I must be the biggest fucking idiot in the whole fucking world!
GAR1B04	A0932A38	Holmes, take it easy. At least we're alive.
GAR1B05	D7941AAE	Carl, friend, fellow traveler, relax, man.
GAR1B06	4E9D4B14	You're really killing my fucking vibe here!
GAR1B07	399A7B82	Well, I'm sorry I'm fucking up your vibe, old man,
GAR1B08	A9256613	but I can't wait to get my hands on that mute
GAR1B09	DE225685	and your bitch ass cousin.
GAR1B10	BEE5DF60	Hey!
GAR1B11	C9E2EFF6	My cousin? You're gonna dis my familia?
GAR1B12	50EBBE4C	My bad, man. I'm just pissed for all of us.
GAR1B13	27EC8EDA	I mean look, we in a strange place, we got shit to our name,
GAR1B14	B9881B79	and for once I try to make something work, this garage,
GAR1B15	CE8F2BEF	and it ain't even a garage.
GAR1B16	57867A55	Then make it into a garage.
GAR1B17	20814AC3	Oh, that's a great idea, sis! Why don't you shut up?
GAR1B18	B03E5752	You know what, Carl, you are a fucking idiot.
GAR1B19	C73967C4	Your whole life you've wanted something for nothing.
GAR1B20	95C88CA3	Now you've got something, and you don't know what to do with it.
GAR1B21	E2CFBC35	Well, make it good enough. We'll help, right?
GAR1B22	7BC6ED8F	C'mon stop tripping, man.
GAR1B23	0CC1DD19	Both of you.
GAR1B24	92A548BA	Woah man, the energy here - it's fantastic.
GAR1B25	E5A2782C	Yeah, alright, but how am I gonna find some good mechanics to work up in here, man?
GAR1B26	7CAB2996	I know a few guys. Come with me, friend.
GAR1B27	0BAC1900	They're good people, I swear it.
GAR1B28	9B130491	We got your back, CJ.
GAR1B29	EC143407	Ommmmmm...
GAR1B30	8CD3BDE2	Oh, man - I'm about to ride with this fool again?
GAR1C00	A63C8416	Nice place you got here.
GAR1C01	D13BB480	A week of hard work and we'll transform this place.
GAR1C02	4832E53A	Cesar, this is Jethro, Dwaine and Zero.
GAR1C03	3F35D5AC	- Hey man.~n~- Dude.
GAR1C04	A151400F	Wassup, B?

GAR1C06	4F5F2123	Horale, let's get to work.
GAR1C07	385811B5	Hey Carl, look - I think I found a way for us to get paid.
GAR1C08	A8E70C24	I ain't going to no college to study no accounting!
GAR1C09	DFE03CB2	No, idiot, property!
GAR1C10	BF27B557	Decorating ain't exactly my thing, either.
GAR1C11	C82085C1	No, property development!
GAR1C12	5129D47B	Look, you buy a dump like this, fix it up and sell it.
GAR1C13	262EE4ED	Or better yet, you turn the property into a business.
GAR1C14	B84A714E	The snowball gets bigger...
GAR1C15	CF4D41D8	I dunno, sis, this all sounds big time to me.
GAR1C16	56441062	Look, Carl, this place is gonna get on its feet,
GAR1C17	214320F4	and when it does, we are gonna have money.
GAR1C18	B1FC3D65	If you want to make something of yourself,
GAR1C19	C6FB0DF3	you gotta let your money work for you.
GAR1C20	940AE694	Look, I wouldn't even know where to start.
GAR1C21	E30DD602	Look, you two concentrate on the garage,
GAR1C22	7A0487B8	and let me work the property thing, OK?
GAR1C23	0D03B72E	Hey, Cesar! Come over here.
GAR1C24	9367228D	Yeah, that's my baby girl right there, holmes!
GAR1C25	E460121B	Man, you chose her, I'm stuck with her!
