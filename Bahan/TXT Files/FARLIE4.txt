FAR4A00	3411ABFE	Hey, Woozie, my man, what's going down?
FAR4A01	43169B68	Hey CJ. Let me introduce you to Shuk Foo Ran Fa Li.
FAR4A02	DA1FCAD2	He heads the Red Gecko Tong on the West Coast.
FAR4A03	AD18FA44	How you doin'?
FAR4A04	337C6FE7	Ah Ah Kung has sent word from Kowloon;
FAR4A05	447B5F71	a Vietnamese crime family, the Da Nang Boys,
FAR4A06	DD720ECB	are preparing to move to the United States.
FAR4A07	AA753E5D	This may explain the cowardly attack on the Blood Feather Triad.

FAR4A13	B403CB05	He is Triad? A Mountain Boy?

FAR4A16	C4693F8A	OK.
FAR4A17	B36E0F1C	Thanks for your support.
