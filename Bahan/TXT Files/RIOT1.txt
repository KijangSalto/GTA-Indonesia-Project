RIOT1	69DDD169	~s~Go back to Sweet's house.
ROT1@00	24D61DF6	Hey, be quiet, be quiet.
ROT1@01	53D12D60	C'mon you bunch of wankers, this is unbearable!
ROT1@02	CAD87CDA	SHUT UP!
ROT1@03	BDDF4C4C	Officers Eddie Pulaski and Frank Tenpenny,
ROT1@04	23BBD9EF	both hard working members of a community policing unit,
ROT1@05	54BCE979	have been charged with racketeering,
ROT1@06	CDB5B8C3	corruption, narcotics and sexual assault.
ROT1@07	BAB28855	They brought it on themselves.
ROT1@08	2A0D95C4	That bastard cost me my farm. And he hogged the bong.
ROT1@09	5D0AA552	But these charges pale in comparison to the core allegation;
ROT1@10	3DCD2CB7	... conspired to kill fellow officer Ralph Pendelbury
ROT1@11	4ACA1C21	who had threatened to turn state's evidence
ROT1@12	D3C34D9B	and who was then found shot dead
ROT1@13	A4C47D0D	in a supposedly unrelated gang incident...
ROT1@14	3AA0E8AE	I'd say 20 years.
ROT1@15	4DA7D838	- Try 5 years. Cops always get off easy.~n~- Yeah, I heard that.
ROT1@16	D4AE8982	...to deal with lost evidence,
ROT1@17	A3A9B914	...retracted witness statements
ROT1@18	3316A485	and now the disappearance of fellow officer Jimmy Hernandez,
ROT1@19	44119413	including fellow officer Jimmy Hernandez,
ROT1@20	16E07F74	and Officer Pulaski himself, believed to be on the run.
ROT1@21	61E74FE2	Oh, wait, they're exiting the courtroom now!
ROT1@22	F8EE1E58	That bastard Pulaski will probably turn up dead, just like the rest of them.
ROT1@23	8FE92ECE	...of the lack of evidence against my client,
ROT1@24	118DBB6D	the district attorney's office has seen fit
ROT1@25	668A8BFB	to drop all charges...
ROT1@26	FF83DA41	What?!
ROT1@27	8884EAD7	I hope we can draw a line under this whole sorry affair
ROT1@28	183BF746	and leave officer Tenpenny to do what he does best;
ROT1@29	6F3CC7D0	Protect and serve!
ROT1@30	0FFB4E35	Thank you.
ROT1@31	78FC7EA3	You see? You can't trust the system, man.
ROT1@32	E1F52F19	If the reaction of the crowd behind me is anything to judge by,
ROT1@33	96F21F8F	...Los Santos will burn tonight!
ROT1@34	08968A2C	You see? You can't trust the system, man!
ROT1@35	7F91BABA	Oh man, there just ain't no JUSTICE!
ROT1@36	E698EB00	I know, I've been arrested numerous times
ROT1@37	919FDB96	for totally natural behavior!
