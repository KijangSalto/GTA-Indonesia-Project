CAS5_DA	991CB9AE	Hey, Johnny, how you feelin'?
CAS5_DB	0015E814	I didn't think he was going to be discharged 'til tomorrow!
CAS5_EA	800788EF	Alright, who's messing with Forelli business?
CAS5_EB	190ED955	Yeah, who's got a death wish?
CAS5A00	E3F5CA8C	Oi, Rosie, liven yourself up, Carl's here.
CAS5A01	94F2FA1A	Hello.
CAS5A02	0DFBABA0	Eh, there's some top fanny down at that pool, Pabsy.
CAS5A03	7AFC9B36	Leave it out, dimlo, what's wrong with you?
CAS5A04	E4980E95	Well are you going to tell him, or shall I?
CAS5A05	939F3E03	I'm really screwed.
CAS5A06	0A966FB9	Crack on, Rosie - spit it out.
CAS5A07	7D915F2F	I threw it all away.
CAS5A08	ED2E42BE	OK, I had the power, the money, the ladies...
CAS5A09	9A297228	But I couldn't lay off the blow, so I went into rehab.
CAS5A10	FAEEFBCD	And everything went to shit, but so what?
CAS5A11	8DE9CB5B	So when I came out I started representing the Liberty City mob, again
CAS5A12	14E09AE1	and that's how I ended up here.
CAS5A13	63E7AA77	But, no one family would trust another family to run the casino,
CAS5A14	FD833FD4	so I was put forth as a neutral party.
CAS5A15	8A840F42	So now I spend my days waiting for one family to cap me
CAS5A16	138D5EF8	and blame the other one.
CAS5A17	648A6E6E	My only friend is a bird named Tony.
CAS5A18	F43573FF	I never fucked anyone over in my life who didn't have it coming to 'em.
CAS5A19	83324369	Shit - let me think about this. You're gonna have to break it down for me real quick.
CAS5A20	D1C3A80E	OK, OK - the Sindaccos are on the warpath.
CAS5A21	A6C49898	OK? I mean, something terrible has happened to Johnny.
CAS5A22	3FCDC922	I mean, he's in a shock-induced coma at the hospital across town.
CAS5A23	48CAF9B4	Now the Forellis - they will take this opportunity to rub him out.
CAS5A24	D6AE6C17	Now if any hit between the families succeeds on my turf,
CAS5A25	A1A95C81	I will get the axe, bullet, machete, whatever...
CAS5A26	38A00D3B	I'm gonna shoot over to the hospital, and move the body or something.
CAS5A27	4FA73DAD	There you go, my love, things ain't so bad, are they?
CAS5A28	DF18203C	Badabing.
CAS5A29	A81F10AA	What's happenin'.
CAS5A30	C8D8994F	OK, OK, relax.
